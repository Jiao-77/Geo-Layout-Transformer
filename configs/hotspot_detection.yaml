# Hotspot Detection Task Configuration

# Inherits from default.yaml

# 1. Data Preprocessing
data:
  # For hotspot detection, we might need smaller, more focused patches
  patch_size: 2.0
  patch_stride: 1.0

# 2. Model Architecture
model:
  # Add a task-specific head for classification
  task_head:
    type: "classification"
    input_dim: 256 # Must match transformer.hidden_dim
    hidden_dim: 64
    output_dim: 1    # Binary classification (Hotspot / Not Hotspot)

# 3. Training
training:
  # Use a loss function suitable for imbalanced datasets
  loss_function: "focal_loss"
  # Task-specific learning rate might be different
  learning_rate: 0.00005
  epochs: 50
