- **EDA I/O**: GDSII/OASIS (via `klayout` Python API)

## 1. Vision

The **Geo-Layout Transformer** is a research project aimed at creating a paradigm shift in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for physical design. Instead of relying on a fragmented set of heuristic-based tools, we are building a single, unified foundation model that understands the deep, contextual "language" of semiconductor layouts.

By leveraging a novel hybrid **Graph Neural Network (GNN) + Transformer** architecture and pre-training on massive amounts of unlabeled GDSII data, this model can be fine-tuned to excel at a variety of critical back-end analysis tasks, including:

*   **High-Precision Connectivity Verification**: Detecting opens and shorts by understanding the layout topology.
*   **Structural Layout Matching**: Enabling IP reuse and design similarity search.
*   **Predictive Hotspot Detection**: Identifying manufacturability issues with high accuracy and low false positives.

Our vision is to move from disparate, task-specific tools to a centralized, reusable "Layout Understanding Engine" that accelerates the design cycle and pushes the boundaries of PPA (Power, Performance, and Area).

## 2. Core Architecture

The model's architecture is designed to hierarchically process layout information, mimicking how a human expert analyzes a design from local details to global context.

1.  **GDSII to Graph Pipeline**: We parse raw GDSII/OASIS files into a rich, heterogeneous graph representation. Each layout "patch" is converted into a graph where polygons and vias are **nodes**, and their physical adjacencies and connectivity are **edges**.

2.  **GNN Patch Encoder**: A powerful Graph Neural Network (specifically, a Relational Graph Attention Network - RGAT) acts as a "local rule learner". It processes the graph of each patch, encoding the complex local geometries and inter-layer relationships into a single, rich feature vector (embedding). This embedding represents a high-level semantic summary of the patch.

3.  **Global Transformer Backbone**: The sequence of patch embeddings is fed into a Transformer model. Crucially, we inject **hybrid 2D positional encodings** (both absolute and relative) to inform the model of each patch's spatial location. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism allows it to detect long-range dependencies, repetitive structures (like standard cell arrays), and global contextual patterns across the entire chip.

4.  **Task-Specific Heads**: The final, context-aware embeddings from the Transformer are fed into simple, lightweight neural network "heads" for specific downstream tasks. This modular design allows the core model to be adapted to new applications with minimal effort.

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1. Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   A Conda environment is highly recommended.
*   Access to EDA tools for generating labeled data (e.g., a DRC engine for hotspot labels).

### 3.2. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Geo-Layout-Transformer.git
    cd Geo-Layout-Transformer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate the Conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n geo_trans python=3.9
    conda activate geo_trans
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project requires PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric (PyG). Please follow the official installation instructions for your specific CUDA version.

    *   **PyTorch:** [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
    *   **PyG:** [https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/installation.html)

    After installing PyTorch and PyG, install the remaining dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You may need to install `klayout` separately via its own package manager or build from source to enable its Python API).*

> Tip: GPU is optional. For CPU-only environments, install the CPU variants of PyTorch/PyG.

## 4. Project Usage

The project workflow is divided into two main stages: data preprocessing and model training.

### 4.1. Stage 1: Data Preprocessing

The first step is to convert your GDSII/OASIS files into a graph dataset that the model can consume.

1.  Place your layout files in the `data/gds/` directory.
2.  Configure the preprocessing parameters in `configs/default.yaml`. You will need to define patch size, stride, layer mappings, and how to construct graph edges.
3.  Run the preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/preprocess_gds.py --config-file configs/default.yaml --gds-file data/gds/my_design.gds --output-dir data/processed/my_design/
    ```
    This script will parse the GDS file, divide it into patches, construct a graph for each patch, and save the processed data as `.pt` files for efficient loading.

### 4.2. Stage 2: Model Training

Once the dataset is ready, you can train the Geo-Layout Transformer.

#### Self-Supervised Pre-training (Recommended)

To build a powerful foundation model, we first pre-train it on unlabeled data using a "Masked Layout Modeling" task.

```bash
python main.py --config-file configs/default.yaml --mode pretrain --data-dir data/processed/my_design/
```
This will train the model to understand the fundamental "grammar" of physical layouts without requiring any expensive labels.

#### Supervised Fine-tuning

After pre-training, you can fine-tune the model on a smaller, labeled dataset for a specific task like hotspot detection.

1.  Ensure your processed data includes labels.
2.  Use a task-specific config file (e.g., `hotspot_detection.yaml`) that defines the model head and loss function.
3.  Run the main script in `train` mode:
    ```bash
    python main.py --config-file configs/hotspot_detection.yaml --mode train --data-dir data/processed/labeled_hotspots/ --checkpoint-path /path/to/pretrained_model.pth
    ```

## 5. Roadmap & Contribution

This project is ambitious and we welcome contributions. Our future roadmap includes:

-   [ ] **Model Interpretability**: Implementing tools to visualize attention maps to understand the model's decisions.
-   [ ] **Full-Chip Scalability**: Integrating graph partitioning techniques (e.g., Cluster-GCN) to handle chip-scale designs.
-   [ ] **Generative Design**: Using the learned representations in a generative framework to synthesize "correct-by-construction" layouts.
